     - If carrying a carrot, it seeks the shortest path to a hole.
     - If not carrying a carrot, it finds the shortest path to a carrot.

### Game Features

- **Grid Display**: The game grid is displayed on the screen, and you control the rabbit's movements within it.

- **Carrots and Rabbit Holes**: Carrots and rabbit holes are randomly placed on the grid. The rabbit's goal is to collect and drop carrots into the holes.

- **Jump Mechanism**: The rabbit can jump over the nearest rabbit hole if the path is clear.

- **Carrot Handling**: Use the `p` key to pick up or drop carrots. The rabbit can carry one carrot at a time.

- **Goal**: The objective of the game is to collect all the carrots and place them in the rabbit holes. Command the rabbit (`g`) strategically to accomplish this or do it manually. The game ends when the rabbit has put all the carrots into the holes.
